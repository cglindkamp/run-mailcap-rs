run-mailcap-rs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cglindkamp/run-mailcap-rs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cglindkamp/run-mailcap-rs)
==============
This is an attempt to rewrite run-mailcap in Rust. The motivation for this is
the need for a file launcher that is more flexible than xdg-open, but I had
various problems with the written in Perl version of run-mailcap. Additionally,
I use it as vehicle to learn Rust.
